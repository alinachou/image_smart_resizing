# image-smart-resizing
<h3>Motivation & Idea:</h3> When displaying images and videos, the devices used for it come in different sizes and shapes. The optimal image and video viewing configuration varies across devices and screen sizes. Due to this, image resizing is very important. The intuitive idea is to rescale or crop the original image to fit the new device, but that often causes artifacts or even loss of important content in images. By using seam carving technique, the important content of the image can be preserved while limiting the artifacts.
